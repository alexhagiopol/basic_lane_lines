[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This project uses a combination of Canny Edge Detection and the Hough Transform to detect lane lines in an input video stream.

## Writeup

### Goals
The goals of this project are the following:

    1. Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road.
    2. Reflect on my work in a written report.

### Demo

Execute the [iPython notebook](https://github.com/alexhagiopol/lane_lines/blob/develop/P1.ipynb)
in this repo to view the working implementation and its results. Below is
an example result of my lane line detection pipeline on a video stream:
