# Finding Lane Lines on the Road
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This project uses a combination of Canny Edge Detection and the Hough Transform to detect lane lines in an input video stream.

## Writeup

### Goals
The goals of this project are the following:

    1. Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road.
    2. Reflect on my work in a written report.

Below is an example result of my lane line detection pipeline on a video stream:

HTML("""
<video width="960" height="540" controls>
  <source src="{0}">
</video>
""".format("result_videos/processed_solidWhiteRight.mp4"))

### Reflection

#### 1. Pipeline Description

#### 2. Potential Shortcomings

#### 3. Future Work
